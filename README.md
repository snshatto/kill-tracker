# Desciprtion
A simple module for Foundryvtt that allows manual tracking of player kills.

After installing the module, a button will appear in the Token Controls menu.

Clicking this button will open the Kill Tracker.

The Kill Tracker features:
  - Actors that are assigned to players are automatically displayed in the kill tracker
  - Edit the input fields next to each actor and click the "save" button to update the kill tracker
  - The kill tracker will persist across sessions, making this a great way to track player kills throughout a campaign
  - Additional actors can be added to the Kill Tracker, either through the select drop-down menu, or by dragging and dropping actors into the Kill Tracker

Important Note:
- The module scope is set to "World", meaning that only the GM can add/remove actors from the kill trackers.
- Players can update their own kills, but only the GM has permission to update all actor kills.
